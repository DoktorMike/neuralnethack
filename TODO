- Optimize the code to make it run faster.
- Statistics:
	* Write a gnuplotable learning curve to a file.
	* Calculate a P-value for the ROC curve.
- Other:
	* Template the Matrix library.
	* Softmax in output layer of MLP.
	* Set binary outputs in Normaliser to be [-1,1] even if it is [0,1]
	  from the beginning. Use z=2x-1 as a transformation for the values
	  that are [-1,1] or [0,1].
	* Fix the checking for command line parsing in autoconf
